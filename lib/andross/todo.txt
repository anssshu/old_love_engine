* Example for using the API without an importer
* Make a better notes.txt on the DragonBones format
* Test layers in AnimationManager (probably hopefully kind of implemented already)
* Skinning
* Importing actual DragonBones files correctly and not just coa tools exports
* A better high-level animation system, that is not something I pulled out of my ass without having ever built or USED one before?
* Curves (only relevant for DragonBones)
* Find a better way to handle the 'if channelName == "angle"'-stuff
